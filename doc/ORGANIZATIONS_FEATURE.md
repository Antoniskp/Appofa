# Organizations Feature

## Overview

Organizations are first-class entities on Appofa, parallel to Locations.
They represent non-geographic entities like companies, institutions, universities, schools, parties, and civic organizations.
Phase 5 extends Organizations with hierarchy (`parentId`), parent/child governance workflows, and per-organization analytics snapshots.

## Phase Roadmap

### Phase 1

- Slug service (`organizationService.generateSlug`)
- Frontend pages:
  - `/organizations`
  - `/organizations/[slug]`
  - `/admin/organizations`

### Phase 2
- Membership workflows (invite/request/join/leave)
- Member management permissions and moderation tools
- Frontend members tab controls for join/leave and admin actions

### Phase 3

- ✅ Public discoverability enhancements (`/official-posts`, `/api/official-posts`)

### Phase 5
